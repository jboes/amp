Amp: Atomistic Machine-learning Potentials
==========================================

Welcome to Amp documentation! This project is being developed at Brown University in the School of Engineering, primarily by **Andrew Peterson** and **Alireza Khorshidi**,
and is released under the GNU General Public License. This is a relatively new project, so things are constantly changing!

(Note that Amp is built off of our previous project, Neural. You may still find Neural at our `bitbucket page <https://bitbucket.org/andrewpeterson/neural>`_.)
